During the course of Multivariate and Categorical Statistics, imparted at ITAM-Mexico by Nasser Sadeghkhani, we decided to compile our R-code developments during the course. Therefore, this book is meant to be read along side the book [Methods of Multivariate Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118391686), written by Alvin C. Rencher.
